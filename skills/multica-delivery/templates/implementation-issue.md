## Goal

Implement the approved change and deliver a reachable candidate commit SHA for verification.

## Approved Inputs

- Parent Issue: `<parent-identifier>`
- Approved Requirements result: `<requirements-comment-ref>`
- Requirements gate approval: `<requirements-gate-ref>`
- Approved Plan result: `<plan-comment-ref>`
- Plan gate approval: `<plan-gate-ref>`
- Baseline SHA: `<baseline-sha>`
- Candidate branch: `<candidate-branch>`
- Target branch: `<target-branch>`
- Target head at candidate creation: `<target-head-sha>`

## Scope

- Work only within the approved Requirements and Plan.
- Preserve pre-existing changes and unrelated files.
- Use TDD for behavior changes and `writing-skills` when creating or changing reusable skills.
- If approved scope touches APIs, storage, background work, consistency, security, observability, or production behavior, read the target repository's backend engineering standards when present and map the relevant constraints to implementation, tests, and verification.
- Use `systematic-debugging` only for unexpected failures.
- Never use `git add .`; stage explicit approved paths only.
- Push HEAD without force to the named candidate branch.

## Deliverables

- Implement the approved change set.
- Run focused tests and repository checks.
- Create the required commits.
- Report the candidate head SHA, remote candidate branch, changed behavior, and verification evidence.

## Completion Criteria

Do not claim completion when tests fail, required evidence is missing, push fails, or the candidate SHA is not reachable on the named remote branch. Return `BLOCKED` with the concrete cause and actions already attempted.

## Reporting Contract

End with:

```text
RESULT: PASS | BLOCKED
ISSUE: <issue key>
HEAD_SHA: <sha or N/A>
REMOTE_BRANCH: <remote branch or N/A>
SUMMARY: <concise outcome>
EVIDENCE: <commands, results, or document sections>
OPEN_ITEMS: <none or explicit items>
```
