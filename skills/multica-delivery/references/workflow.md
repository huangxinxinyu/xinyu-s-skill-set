# Workflow Reference

## Parent Queue

One Goal may track up to three open parent Issues at a time. Tracking means the parent belongs to that Goal's delivery queue through parent metadata, not that work is advancing on all of them.

Queue invariants:

- exactly one tracked parent has `queue_state = active`
- additional tracked parents use `queue_state = queued`
- accepted parents use `queue_state = complete`
- parent queue order is explicit through `queue_position`
- QA and Review may run in parallel only within the active parent

Queued parents remain inactive until promoted. Do not create or advance child Issues for queued parents.

## Parent and Child Issues

Every requirement gets one parent Issue plus stage-specific child Issues when that parent becomes active. The parent Issue holds recovery metadata only. Detailed outputs stay in child Issue comments and Git.

Typical successful flow:

```text
Parent Issue
|-- Stage 1: Requirements -> Delivery Expert
|-- Stage 2: Plan -> Delivery Expert
|-- Stage 3: Implementation -> Delivery Expert
`-- Stage 4: QA -> QA
               Review -> Reviewer
```

If verification fails:

```text
Stage 4: QA and/or Review fail
Stage 5: Rework -> Delivery Expert
Stage 6: QA -> QA
         Review -> Reviewer
```

Stages are execution-wave numbers for audit and recovery. They do not approve output and they do not replace role-specific Issue content.

## Issue Lifecycle

1. Create or select the parent Issue and set its queue metadata.
2. If the parent is not first in queue, leave it `queue_state = queued` and stop there.
3. For the active parent, create each child Issue in `backlog`.
4. Fill all required inputs.
5. Assign the correct Agent.
6. Move the Issue to `todo` only after the inputs are complete.
7. Wait for the Agent result comment.
8. Apply the gate rules in `gates.md`.

## Approved Inputs by Stage

- Requirements: parent Issue, normalized user request, repository context, and any relevant design/spec references.
- Plan: approved Requirements result and any resolved gate clarifications.
- Implementation: approved Requirements, approved Plan, baseline SHA, candidate branch, target branch, recorded target head SHA, and any explicit safety exclusions.
- QA: approved Requirements, approved Plan, baseline SHA, candidate branch, candidate SHA, and the coverage focus.
- Review: approved Requirements, approved Plan, baseline SHA, candidate branch, candidate SHA, and the exact diff range.
- Rework: the specific QA/Review findings to address, the baseline from the failed wave, the candidate branch, the target branch, and the candidate SHA being replaced.

## Role Boundaries

- Codex alone creates Issues, approves gates, and communicates with the user.
- Delivery Expert is the only code-writing Agent.
- QA and Reviewer inspect the named SHA only and remain read-only.
- Codex alone performs the accepted fast-forward merge into the target branch.
- Codex alone writes and commits the post-merge run memory file.

## Candidate Transport

- Delivery Expert runs the required checks, commits the approved change, and pushes the candidate branch.
- Never force push the candidate branch.
- Codex verifies the remote candidate branch and SHA before opening QA and Review.
- QA and Review must inspect the same remote candidate branch tip and reported candidate SHA.

## Final Acceptance

Accept the implementation only when:

- Requirements and Plan are approved
- implementation remains in approved scope
- the candidate SHA is reachable on the named remote candidate branch
- QA and Review both pass the same final SHA
- the recorded target branch head still matches the current target branch head
- the accepted candidate can be applied as a fast-forward update to the target branch

Codex verifies the remote candidate branch and SHA before opening QA and Review.

If the target branch head moved after candidate creation, stop acceptance and create an integration or rework path from the new target head before another verification wave.

Record the accepted candidate as `final_sha`. Codex then fast-forward merges it into the target branch, pushes normally, and verifies that the remote target tip equals `final_sha`.

Codex next writes `memory/runs/<parent-identifier>.md`, commits only that path, pushes the target branch normally, and records the resulting commit as `memory_commit_sha`. No second QA and Review wave is required for this memory-only commit. Codex must verify that its diff changes exactly the canonical memory file, the file records `final_sha` and the accepted QA/Review evidence, the remote target tip equals `memory_commit_sha`, and `final_sha` is an ancestor.

Only then update the parent metadata to `queue_state = complete` and promote the next queued parent by moving it to `queue_state = active`. Promotion is a deterministic operating step, not a distributed lock.
