# Gate Reference

## Requirements Gate

Pass only when the result clearly states:

- goal and intended actor
- in-scope and out-of-scope behavior
- business rules, constraints, and edge cases
- testable acceptance criteria
- unresolved questions that genuinely require Codex or human input

Reject incomplete analysis on the same Issue when the missing work is editorial or discoverable from existing evidence. Block only when a real business decision is missing.

## Plan Gate

Pass only when the result names:

- current behavior and file boundaries
- target behavior and affected components
- ordered implementation steps with dependencies
- risks, rollback thinking, and compatibility concerns
- test-first or contract-first verification tied to acceptance criteria

Reject vague or non-executable plans on the same Issue. Block only when the approved Requirements cannot support a safe implementation plan.

## Implementation Gate

Pass only when:

- the reported SHA exists in Git
- the reported SHA is reachable on the named remote candidate branch
- the diff stays within approved scope
- required checks ran and the evidence is credible
- any commit structure requested by the plan is present

Reject for incomplete evidence, missing commits, push failure, or scope drift. Do not open verification against a candidate SHA that is not reachable on the named remote branch.

## Verification Gate

QA and Review run in parallel against the same remote candidate branch and SHA. The gate passes only when both conclude `PASS` for that exact SHA.

If either role returns `FAIL`, create a Rework Issue instead of retrying verification on the unchanged SHA.

Use `BLOCKED` only for missing context or broken infrastructure, not for business or code defects.

## Acceptance Merge Gate

Pass only when:

- QA and Review both passed the same remote candidate SHA
- the current target branch head still matches the `target_head_sha` recorded at candidate creation
- the target branch can be fast-forwarded directly to the accepted candidate SHA
- Codex, not an Agent, performs the merge and push

If the target branch head moved after candidate creation, block acceptance and create an integration or rework path from the new target head.

Merge or push failure keeps the parent incomplete and must be recorded as a concrete blocker.

## Memory Finalization Gate

After the acceptance merge, pass only when:

- the remote target branch tip equals the verified `final_sha` before the memory commit
- Codex creates the commit and no Agent writes repository memory
- The memory-only commit may change only `memory/runs/<parent-identifier>.md`.
- the memory file records `final_sha` and the accepted QA and Review evidence
- the memory commit is pushed normally and recorded as `memory_commit_sha`
- the remote target branch tip equals `memory_commit_sha` and contains `final_sha` as an ancestor

The memory-only commit does not require another QA and Review wave because it cannot change implementation or framework files. Any extra changed path, missing required content, commit failure, push failure, or ancestry failure keeps the parent incomplete and must be recorded as a concrete blocker.

## Correction vs Rework

Use a focused correction on the same Issue when:

- the output is incomplete
- required evidence is missing
- the work can be fixed without changing the accepted code or business state

Create a Rework wave when:

- implementation must change
- QA or Review found a blocking defect
- the candidate SHA changes

Every new candidate SHA invalidates prior final acceptance evidence.
